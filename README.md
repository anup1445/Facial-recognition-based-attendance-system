Face Recognition using Siamese Networks

This repository contains the implementation of a face recognition model using Siamese Networks. Siamese Networks are a type of neural network architecture that learns to differentiate between inputs by comparing them, commonly used in tasks such as face recognition, signature verification, and similarity detection.

Overview
This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for face recognition tasks. The model takes a pair of facial images as input and outputs a similarity score indicating how likely the two faces belong to the same person. The key components of the project include:

Siamese Network Architecture: Utilizes a neural network architecture consisting of twin networks that share weights, enabling them to learn embeddings that represent facial features.

Triplet Loss Function: Employed to train the Siamese Network, ensuring that embeddings of the same person's faces are pulled close together in the embedding space while embeddings of different people's faces are pushed apart.

Dataset Preparation: Guidelines on how to prepare and structure the dataset for training, including data preprocessing steps.

Training Procedure: Instructions on how to train the Siamese Network using the prepared dataset, including hyperparameter tuning suggestions.

Evaluation: Techniques to evaluate the performance of the trained model, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
